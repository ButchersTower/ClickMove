Things to add, damage control.

Abilities, attack speed, ui

De ridge the map, work on culling.

Re sizeable text box, botBox should have 5 lines.
Scrolling text box.

Health drawing.

Player collision detection for walls.

Path finding needs updates:
can't walk diagonal if you can't walk both adjacent horizontal.
can approach blocks from different angles and can only exit from specific ones.
when player walks it cancels path movement.


Fix diagonal check with pathfinding so it checks an array that specifically explains
 which blocks can be diagonally walked into and out of.
 
save click location and button click 
 and then during the next tick have it do the appropriate checks so clicking can't 
 fuck stuff up when it is out of order.
 
 
When mine a node have it be depleted till it regenerates
 HOW DO DEAL WITH RESOURCE NODES
 
 
 	// I should make a chat bar at the bottom, like a console.
	// first make it so you print to it, then have it so you can type to it.

	// Character can diagonally walk off top of screen.

	// If button above inventory pressed the drwGm for g3 stops drawing the invs
	// and draws stats instead because of an if-else-if statement.

	// Have a special in game. For one day, 24 hours. every time a boss is
	// killed
	// something happens. Or every time a mob is given spider tongues he
	// increases
	// in size by .05% or sumptin. The server with the largest mob has the mob
	// then go on a world wide rampage and drop epic loots

	// When moving daig. the player can walk into the corner of blocks.
	// But that wont matter when i install A* pathfinding.

	// how deal with a second map checker. No still just check one map but make
	// it draw the bot ground ad the wall map



Other mobs


if the player can not exit the north block to the east then it can not walk
 north east.


remember the mineloc when trying to mine.
When wantToMine is set to true remember where the mineNode is.


If click on node in melee range then have the player just mine instead
 of walk then mine. well as of now it doesn't even do anything


When pathfinding to ore make sure that diagonal movement count as 1.5 the
 adjacent movement

Drop down when there is no a 2nd button it still seems to think that there is.

Right click button for mine, have it so if there is no above right click then
 the button shuffles up

It doesn't need to replace the tempButs every tick, just needs to make it once
 and redraw it. If it doesnt need to draw the set it to null. 


Make it open door when it gets into melee range like the ore. Make open door
 be the first drop so when you leftclick it auto opens. Make leftclick check
 to see which drops would be there and do what the first one would be.
